## 📚 Overview

This workbook provides foundational and applied knowledge in:

- Database concepts (keys, relationships, relational vs. non-relational models)
- SQL operations (JOINs, INSERTs, SELECTs, filtering, aggregating)
- Database design for a real-world retail use case
- Querying and analysis with the `world_db` database

---

## 📆 Tasks by Day

### 🔹 Day 1: Database Concepts
- Defined **primary**, **secondary**, and **foreign keys**
- Explored real-world relationship types:
  - One-to-one (e.g., passport and person)
  - One-to-many (e.g., department to employees)
  - Many-to-many (e.g., students and classes)

---

### 🔹 Day 1: Relational vs. Non-Relational
- Compared data models, structure, and scalability
- Non-relational benefits explained for:
  - Unstructured data (e.g., images, articles)
  - Real-time applications (e.g., social media)

---

### 🔹 Day 3: SQL JOINs
Explained and demonstrated 6 JOIN types:
- `INNER JOIN`
- `LEFT JOIN`
- `RIGHT JOIN`
- `FULL JOIN`
- `CROSS JOIN`
- `SELF JOIN`

Includes examples of when to use each JOIN type in real-world data scenarios.

---

### 🔹 Day 4: Database Design (Retail Shop Project)
Designed a SQL-based database for a convenience store, including:
- Schema for tables: `Products`, `Customers`, `Sales`, `SaleDetails`, `Suppliers`
- Defined relationships with `FOREIGN KEY`s
- SQL examples: `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, referential integrity

Covered:
- Inventory management
- Loyalty points tracking
- Secure data access and backup practices

---

## 🧪 SQL Practice (World Database)
Ran and documented SQL queries using `world_db` to answer real-world questions, such as:
- ✅ Most/least populated cities
- 🌍 Country with highest life expectancy
- 📊 Cities with GDP per capita above average
- 🌎 Capital cities and cities by region
- 🧠 Frequency of city names
- 🏙️ Cities starting with 'New' or 'Be'
- 🔢 Cities with populations between given thresholds

Queries included:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCitiesInUSA FROM City WHERE CountryCode = 'USA';
SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy FROM Country ORDER BY LifeExpectancy DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT Name AS City FROM City WHERE Name LIKE 'New%';
